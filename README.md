esp32-test-stubs
================

Sample PoC of PyPi packaging [PEP-561][1] stubs for Micropython Esp32. 

As it is only "proof-of-concept" it NOT assumed to for production use and package can be deleted in the future. 
Another purspose of this project is collect info about stubbing

For the production implementation please see:
 - https://pypi.org/project/micropython-esp32-stubs
 - https://pypi.org/project/micropython-esp8266-stubs
 - https://pypi.org/project/micropython-stm32-stubs
 - https://pypi.org/project/micropython-rp2-stubs
 - **https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs**

## Installation

```shell 
pip3 install esp32-test-stubs
```

## Script

Next script correct working in PyCharm for autocompete and analyzing with only installed stub package via standart `pip` command. All types does not show any warnings and recognized properly:

```python
import machine
machine.freq()

import esp32
esp32.NVS()
esp32.wake_on_ext0("Test")

from esp.sub_pkg import sub_pkg_fun
sub_pkg_fun()

from esp32.sub_pkg import sub_pkg_function
sub_pkg_function()

import uuid

# Points to stdlib
uuid.uuid4()

# Points to stub (mean partial stub, so extent stdlib)
# (see uuid-stubs and py.typed)
uuid.uuid6()

import upip
upip.cleanup()
```

## Stubs possible locations

- Project root `*.pyi` files
- `<package>-stubs` with `__init__.pyi` (see [stub-only packages][2])
- `<package>-stubs/<sub_package>.pyi` (see [stub-only-packages][2])
- "custom folders" (**Not recommended**) - like `src`, marked as `package = [{ include = "*.pyi" , from = "src"}]`, under hood all `*.pyi`
  will be moved into package root during package build.  
  **CONS**: 
    - "custom folders" does not recognize as stub source before stub package will pack properly. 
    -  stubs not moved properly in in target `*.tar.gz` build, so it led to potential errors during stub recognition from pure sources.

Note: all of these variants should be explicitly marked in `pyproject.toml` in `Poetry` (see `package` section `pyproject.toml`)

## Poetry commands

- Prepare
  ```shell 
  poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
  poetry config pypi-token.testpypi <TOKEN>

  poetry config repositories.pypi https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  poetry config pypi-token.pypi <TOKEN>
  ```

- Publish
  ```shell 
  poetry publish --build -r testpypi
  poetry publish --build -r pypi
  ```
